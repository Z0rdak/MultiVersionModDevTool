# Multi Version Mod Development Tool

A cli tool to make development of minecraft mods spanning different version and modloaders more effortless.

It features:

- Configurable meta-data of mod, build and upload settings
- Synchronization of common files/directories across versions/modloaders
- Building of all jars using gradle
- Verifying build integrity of the jars (TBD)
